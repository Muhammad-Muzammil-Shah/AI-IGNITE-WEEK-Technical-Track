    Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns caused primarily by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. The Earth's climate has naturally fluctuated throughout history, but scientific evidence shows that current warming trends are occurring at an unprecedented rate and scale.

    Greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide trap heat in Earth's atmosphere, creating what is known as the greenhouse effect. While some greenhouse effect is natural and necessary for life on Earth, human activities have significantly increased atmospheric concentrations of these gases since the Industrial Revolution. Carbon dioxide levels have increased by over 40% since pre-industrial times.

    The primary sources of greenhouse gas emissions include burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, industrial processes, agriculture, and transportation. Coal, oil, and natural gas combustion for electricity, heat, and transportation are the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions globally. Deforestation reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

    Evidence of climate change is observable worldwide through rising global temperatures, melting ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels, and changing precipitation patterns. The past decade included nine of the ten warmest years on record. Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13% per decade, while mountain glaciers are retreating globally.

    The impacts of climate change are far-reaching and affect ecosystems, human health, agriculture, and economic systems. Rising sea levels threaten coastal communities and island nations. Extreme weather events including hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns affect crop yields and food security.

    Addressing climate change requires both mitigation and adaptation strategies. Mitigation involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency improvements, sustainable transportation, and carbon capture technologies. Adaptation involves preparing for and adjusting to climate change impacts through infrastructure improvements, ecosystem restoration, and policy changes.

    Renewable energy sources including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power offer clean alternatives to fossil fuels. Technological advances have made renewable energy increasingly cost-competitive with traditional energy sources. Energy storage solutions and smart grid technologies are helping to overcome challenges associated with renewable energy intermittency.

    International cooperation is essential for addressing climate change effectively. The Paris Agreement brings together nations to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, current national commitments are insufficient to meet this goal, requiring more ambitious action from governments, businesses, and individuals worldwide.
